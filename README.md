# WSN-energy-consumption-benchmark
A benchmark to evaluate the efficiency of WSN data-driven algorithms for energy conservation


# Summary
Most research on energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks has concluded that the communication subsystem consumes significantly more energy than the sensing and computing ones. In order to verify this claim, we have conducted an experimental study with a Pysense sensor shield that utilizes WiFi and LoRa radio models for communication. It employs two data management strategies for energy conservation that have been demonstrated to be efficient through simulations and examines the obtained results on real hardware. The findings of this work indicate that concentrating on lowering the energy consumption of the communication subsystem was advantageous while utilizing WiFi was less effective and promising when using LoRa. Additionally, it demonstrates the importance of optimizing the activation of multiple subsystems in order to achieve sufficient efficiency.
